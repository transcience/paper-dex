  sample={50 transgender women (25 who had undergone GRS), 50 transgender men (22 who had undergone GRS), 88 eating disorder subjects (26 anorexia nervosa, 26 bulimia nervosa, and 36 binge eating disorder), and 107 healthy subjects.},
  conclusion={Gender dysphoria and eating disorders are characterized by a severe body uneasiness, which represents the core of distress in both conditions. Different dimensions of body uneasiness seem to be involved in gender dysphoria subsamples, depending on reassignment stage and genotypic sex. In eating disorder subjects body uneasiness is primarily linked to general psychopathology, whereas in gender dysphoria such a relationship is lacking.},
