  conclusion={Like in many areas of science, it is difficult to unravel cause and effect. It is important to iterate that none of the studies presented provide us with a definite cause for gender dysphoria. It is also likely that gender dysphoria, and the social experiences it confers, also shape the brain. Additionally, many of these studies hint at different mechanisms affecting trans-men compared to trans-women. It could very well turn out that gender dysphoria has completely different root causes affecting trans-men and trans-women. It will take many more years of research and many more studies before we understand what is really going on inside the brains of transgender people. As new research becomes available we will work to summarize and update this article accordingly.},
