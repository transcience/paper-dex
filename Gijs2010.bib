  conclusion={"The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) conducted a consensus process in order to develop recommendations for the refinement of diagnoses for Gender Identity Disorders and Transvestic Fetishism for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). This article is the report of the work group on Transvestic Fetishism. It reviews the history of the diagnosis of Transvestic Fetishism in the DSM, the current DSM-IV-TR classification, and the prevalence and characteristics of the phenomenon of transvestic fetishism. The problems with the current diagnostic classification are reviewed. Based on the consensus process, a new diagnostic label and diagnostic criteria are presented. The new diagnosis is Transvestic Disorder, defined by two criteria: (a) recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing and (b) the fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors are causing clinical distress or impairment in important areas of psychological functioning; that is, the distress is not solely due to external prejudice, stigma, or oppression."}
