  sample={183 news articles by the BBC written about transgender individuals or topics.},
  conclusion={Overall, the study shows that the number of articles covering transgender issues or simply using the term transgender has been consistently increasing over the past 8 years. We expect the number to continue increasing in future years. Despite the limitations of this study we have found striking differences in how the BBC has reported on transgender subjects and issues between the years 2006 and 2014, both in terms of content and language. We have found evidence of transphobia in a large proportion of BBC articles. We strongly suspect such transphobia is common across all forms of media, although further research is required. However, we have also found that the levels of transphobia have dropped in recent years, although there is not enough evidence to suggest a downward trend. Finally, we have presented a dataset, free for the community to access, to aid future researchers in this and other areas.},
