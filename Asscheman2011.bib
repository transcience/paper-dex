  title={A long-term follow-up study of mortality in transsexuals receiving treatment with cross-sex hormones},
  author={Asscheman, Henk and Giltay, Erik J and Megens, Jos AJ and van Trotsenburg, Michael AA and Gooren, Louis JG},
  journal={European Journal of Endocrinology},
  volume={164},
  number={4},
  pages={635--642},
  year={2011},
  publisher={EFES},
  sample={1331 (966 trans-women and 365 trans-men).},
  conclusion={"The increased mortality in hormone-treated MtF transsexuals was mainly due to non-hormone-related causes, but ethinyl estradiol may increase the risk of cardiovascular death. In the FtM transsexuals, use of testosterone in doses used for hypogonadal men seemed safe."}
