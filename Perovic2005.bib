  conclusion={"The technique provides results that have the most normal anatomical and physiological characteristics, in comparison to other methods, since all penile entities are used (except corpora cavernosa) to form almost normal external female genitalia. Vaginoplasty using pedicled penile skin with a urethral flap could be a very good alternative to other methods of vaginoplasty."}
