  title={OR42-3: Morbidity in a Multisite Retrospective Study of Cross-Sex Hormone-Treated Transgender Persons},
  author={Asscheman, Henk and T'Sjoen, Guy G and Gooren, Louis J},
  year={2014},
  sample={~2000},
  conclusion={"Our data show a very reassuring picture of side effects with cross-sex hormone treatment. Our observations are biased because we have no data on those who were lost after few visits (lost to follow up) and those who went to other clinics ("shoppers"). Nevertheless our data confirm the reassuring data from studies with smaller numbers published in the last 10 years."}
